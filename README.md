# Stopwatch_Project
I have done this project with the help of HTML, CSS, JS.
# Stopwatch Application

This is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides a user interface for tracking time and includes start, pause, and reset functionality.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the stopwatch application.

2. The interface will display the stopwatch time in the format: `hh : mm : ss : ms` (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds).

3. Buttons:
   - **Start:** Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch. The timer will start counting up, and you'll see the time increasing on the display.
   - **Pause:** Click the "Pause" button to pause the stopwatch. The timer will stop counting until you click "Start" again.
   - **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00:00 and stop the timer.

4. The stopwatch supports millisecond precision, counting up to 99 milliseconds before rolling over to seconds, minutes, and hours.

## Code Files

### `index.html`

The HTML file contains the structure of the stopwatch interface, including the title, time display, and control buttons.

### `style.css`

The CSS file provides styling for the appearance of the stopwatch interface, including colors, fonts, and layout.

### `script.js`

The JavaScript file adds functionality to the stopwatch. It handles the timing logic for the stopwatch and responds to user interactions with the start, pause, and reset buttons.

## Acknowledgments

This stopwatch application is a basic example of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interactive web application. It can be further customized and enhanced to include additional features or styling.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
